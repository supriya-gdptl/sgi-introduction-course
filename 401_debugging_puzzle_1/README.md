# Debugging Puzzle 1: A Broken Mesh Reader

Note: unlike the other exercises, there are no specific notes associated with these puzzles. Your job is to practice debugging, and figure out what is going wrong!

In this first puzzle, we have written a very simple file reader for the `.obj` mesh file format. It takes in a file, and returns arrays of mesh vertices and faces, like we have been using in the previous examples.

However, there is a bug in this function! The input file is fine, but something is wrong with the output arrays. Your job is to figure out what (and if you can, fix the problem).

Tips:
- Try visualizing the loaded mesh
- Print out the arrays to your terminal, check if anything is obviously wrong with the values
- Check statistics of the arrays, such as their mean/max/min
- If you see any error messages, follow-up on them
